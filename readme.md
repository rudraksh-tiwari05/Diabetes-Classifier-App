# Diabetes Classifier App ðŸ©ºðŸ’‰

This is a simple web application built with Streamlit to predict diabetes based on input data using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

## Features

- Load the diabetes dataset
- Train an SVM classifier
- Accept user input for new data
- Make predictions on new data

## Setup

1. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy streamlit scikit-learn
   ```

2. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-classifier-app.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd diabetes-classifier-app
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run diabetes_classifier_app.py
   ```

5. Open the provided URL in your web browser to access the app.

## Usage

- Upon opening the app, you'll see an input form where you can enter new data.
- Fill in the required fields (e.g., Pregnancies, Glucose, BMI, etc.).
- Click the "Predict" button to see the prediction (whether the person is diabetic or not).

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- streamlit
- scikit-learn

## About

This app is part of a project to demonstrate building a simple machine learning application using Streamlit and scikit-learn. Feel free to explore the code and modify it as needed for your own projects!
